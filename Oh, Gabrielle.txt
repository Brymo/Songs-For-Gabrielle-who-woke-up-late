Oh Gabrielle
Waking up late in the morning's old fate

Oh Gabrielle, you're late

Never knew time, your sleep was sublime

Instead you decided, to wake or to fight it, at forty past nine

Why are you so tired,
Why stay up all this time

I never knew how much sleep can do

Probably you were watching anime
Staying up so late

It's you. Gabrielle this you.
